# SOC 2 Type II Audit Prep

Six observation-period-disciplined questions before any Type II cycle.

## When to Run
- Pre-observation period (months 1–2)
- Mid-observation period (month 6 checkpoint)
- Pre-field-test (month 10)
- Post-report (planning next cycle)
- After scope change (adding TSC category)
- After major incident during observation period

## The Six SOC 2 Type II Questions

### 1. What's the scope, and which TSC categories are in?
- **Security** (Common Criteria CC1–CC9) — always required
- **Availability (A1):** for SaaS with SLA commitments
- **Processing Integrity (PI1):** for transactional/financial data systems
- **Confidentiality (C1):** for proprietary/confidential data
- **Privacy (P1–P8):** for personal data systems
- AICPA AT-C 205 description of system: complete + accurate + boundaries clear

### 2. Did any control skip a cycle during observation period?
**Type II requires consistent operation — single skipped cycle = likely exception.**
- Quarterly controls (e.g., access reviews): all 4 quarters covered
- Monthly controls (e.g., vulnerability scans): all months covered
- Continuous controls (e.g., logging): no gaps
- Annual controls (e.g., BCP exercises, training): completed within period

### 3. Show me the change-management evidence for any control implemented mid-period.
**Mid-period changes = high audit risk.**
- New controls: documented with change-management
- Modified controls: rationale + effective date + impact on prior samples
- **Strategy: avoid mid-period changes; defer to next cycle.**

### 4. Where's the exception log, and what's the materiality assessment?
**Real-time exception logging — not retroactive.**
- Each exception logged when discovered
- Per exception: what / when / impact / remediation / owner
- Materiality: does it affect overall control operation?
- Audit firm tolerance: typically 1–2 exceptions per control acceptable; 3+ = finding

### 5. Show me sample evidence from each TSC criterion in the FIRST month of observation.
**Not the last week — the first month.**
- Front-loaded evidence demonstrates operational discipline
- Back-loaded evidence (last 30 days) = "scrambling" signal
- Sample IDs should be reproducible from operational systems

### 6. What's the cross-walk to ISO 27001, and which evidence reuses?
**75% control overlap — the canonical pair.**
- Each shared artefact cited by both audits (one collection, two reports)
- Coordinate audit calendar with ISO 27001
- Avoid producing duplicate evidence files for same control

## Output Verdict
🟢 **ON-TRACK** | 🟡 **NEEDS-ATTENTION** | 🔴 **MATERIAL-RISK**

Plus top 3 actions with owner + observation-period timing.
